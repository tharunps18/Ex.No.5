## 1. Aim  

The primary aim of this experiment is to investigate the role of prompts in shaping ChatGPT’s responses. The study compares two styles of prompting:  

- **Naive Prompting**: Broad, vague, and unstructured instructions.  
- **Basic Prompting**: Clear, specific, and structured instructions.  

The objective is to identify how the structure and clarity of prompts influence:  

1. The **quality** of ChatGPT’s outputs.  
2. The **accuracy** of factual and technical responses.  
3. The **depth** of explanation and reasoning provided.  
4. The **usefulness** of the response for real-world tasks.  

This experiment is valuable because modern AI models respond differently depending on how the question is phrased. By systematically comparing naive and basic prompting, we can derive a set of best practices for effective interaction with AI tools.

## 2. Algorithm Steps  

The procedure followed in this study is described step-by-step below:  

1. **Define Prompt Types**  
   - Establish what qualifies as a naive prompt and what qualifies as a basic prompt.  

2. **Prepare Test Scenarios**  
   - Select eighteen different scenarios covering domains such as creative writing, factual questions, summarization, advice, technical programming, and problem-solving.  

3. **Maintain Controlled Environment**  
   - Use the same version of ChatGPT throughout to avoid variations in model updates or system behavior.  

4. **Execute Naive Prompt**  
   - Pose the naive version of the question to ChatGPT and record the output.  

5. **Execute Basic Prompt**  
   - Pose the basic, structured version of the same question and record the output.  

6. **Repeat for All Scenarios**  
   - Collect responses for all eighteen scenarios, giving a total of thirty-six outputs (eighteen naive, eighteen basic).  

7. **Tabulate Responses**  
   - Organize the results in a structured format for easy comparison.  

8. **Evaluate Against Key Parameters**  
   - Judge responses on quality, accuracy, depth, and usefulness.  

9. **Analyze and Interpret Results**  
   - Discuss differences, strengths, and weaknesses of both prompting styles.  

10. **Formulate Best Practices**  
    - Derive a set of rules and guidelines for effective use of ChatGPT.

## 3. Definition of Prompt Types  

### Naive Prompting  

Naive prompts are usually short, vague, and general. They lack context, constraints, or specificity. While they can trigger creative or unexpected responses, they often produce shallow, generic, or incomplete answers.  

**Example Naive Prompt:**  
- “Explain climate change.”  

**Likely Response:**  
- A broad description of climate change without structure or examples.  

### Basic Prompting  

Basic prompts are precise, contextual, and structured. They guide the AI by setting expectations about tone, detail level, examples, or format. These prompts tend to produce accurate, comprehensive, and user-oriented answers.  

**Example Basic Prompt:**  
- “Explain climate change in simple terms for a high-school student, using three real-world examples and ending with a short conclusion.”  

**Likely Response:**  
- A well-structured explanation with clear examples and a concluding statement tailored for the specified audience.

## 4. Preparation of Multiple Test Scenarios  

To cover a wide range of AI use cases, eighteen different test scenarios were prepared. They fall under six categories:  

1. **Creative Writing** – storytelling, poetry, dialogues.  
2. **Factual Q&A** – science, history, and current affairs.  
3. **Summarization** – articles, research papers, and reports.  
4. **Advice and Guidance** – study tips, health, career planning.  
5. **Programming and Technical** – coding, debugging, and algorithm design.  
6. **Analytical and Problem-Solving** – environmental issues, leadership strategies, and critical thinking exercises.  

For each scenario, two prompts were designed: one naive and one basic. This ensured a direct comparison of outputs for the same underlying task.  

---

## 5. Running Experiments  

Each scenario was executed twice—once with a naive prompt and once with a basic prompt. Responses were recorded in their raw form without modification.  

The responses were then compared against four evaluation parameters:  

- **Quality** – clarity, coherence, and relevance.  
- **Accuracy** – correctness of facts and information.  
- **Depth** – level of detail and explanation provided.  
- **Usefulness** – practical applicability of the response.  

This process allowed an objective evaluation of differences between naive and basic prompting styles.  

---

## 6. Recording Responses and Tabulation  

The collected responses were entered into comparative tables. Each table contained:  

1. Scenario description.  
2. Naive prompt and corresponding response.  
3. Basic prompt and corresponding response.  
4. Analysis of the difference in output quality.  

An example entry is shown below:  

| Scenario | Naive Prompt | Basic Prompt | Naive Response | Basic Response | Analysis |  
|----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------|  
| Story Writing | Write a story. | Write a story about a dragon who becomes a chef in a medieval kingdom, focusing on how he learns to cook and wins the hearts of villagers. | Generic, unfocused short story. | Detailed, imaginative story with a clear theme. | Basic prompt led to a more structured and engaging narrative. |  

---

## 7. Evaluation Parameters  

To evaluate the responses systematically, the following criteria were used:  

| Parameter   | Naive Prompting | Basic Prompting |  
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
| Quality     | Moderate – generic, less polished | High – structured, coherent, tailored |  
| Accuracy    | Medium – occasional factual gaps | High – well-researched and correct |  
| Depth       | Low – surface-level detail | High – in-depth explanations |  
| Usefulness  | Limited – lacks actionable insights | High – practical and relevant |
